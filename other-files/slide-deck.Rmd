## Overview

The goal of the Data Science Capstone Project is to build a word
prediction app deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). These applications are
very useful while typing on a mobile device. They also find use in
predicting errors made by users while using search engines.

The following slides contain:

- Description of the algorithm used to make prediction

- How to Use the app and Comments on accuracy

- Conclusion and additional information

## Algorithm for prediction

- The prediction starts with cleaning the input 
	- e.g., removing punctuation and making all cases lower
	
- An offline Ngram is built and optimized for memory and speed
	- Memory optimization for accuracy and speed led to 3s (from 30s)
  to load and \<1s (from \>10s) to predict for the same accuracy.
	
- Computing the [maximum likelihood estimation or MLE](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/Engineering/CS-224N/asset/slp4.pdf) based on the
  input and computed Ngrams (in this case 4gram to 2gram)
  
- Sorting and showing the output based on highest probability.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./shiny.png',dpi=100)
```

## How the app works and Accuracy

- Input is obtained and the `Predict` button is clicked to display
  output and `Clear` is used to remove the output.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="20%", out.height="5%",fig.cap="Input and Output",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("./shiny1.png","./shiny2.png"))
``` 

- Accuracy was tested to be 21% using [this benchmarking tool](https://github.com/hfoffani/dsci-benchmark) with
  entire corpus.

- Memory optimization for accuracy and speed led to 3s (from 30s) to load and
  \<1s (from \>10s) to predict for the same accuracy.
